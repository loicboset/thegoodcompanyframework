# The Good Company Framework 

The Good Company Framework is meant to be a **free web-app for wannabe entrepreneurs who have a project idea but don't know where to start!**

## Example

You are an accountant working in a big company and you are bored to death. But you have this great and innovative project idea and you want to pursue it!
Exept that you only have a few hours a week to work on this idea and you really don't know where to start or how to make progress. And time is flying.

With The Good Company Framework, you just have to enter the name of your project idea with a small description and you will be guided, step by step, until you have reached validation (i.e. you know the problem you want to solve is real and that your solution is effective).
